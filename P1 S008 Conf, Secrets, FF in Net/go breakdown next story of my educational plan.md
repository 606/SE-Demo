## **Configuration, Secrets Management, and Feature Flags in .NET Cloud**

This story covers modern approaches and best practices for handling configuration, secrets, and feature management in scalable, secure .NET cloud applications. It includes environment-specific configuration, secure storage of secrets, dynamic reloading, integration with cloud-native secret stores, and safe feature rollout.

Below is the atomic breakdown (theory, practice, checklist) for this story, starting at item 1:

- [ ] No hardcoded settings in codebase
- [ ] Configuration files are environment-agnostic
- [ ] Sensitive data is not stored in config files

---

#### THEORY 2: Describe hierarchical configuration and configuration providers in .NET.

#### PRACTICE 2: Use `IConfiguration` and providers (JSON, environment variables, command line).

#### CHECKLIST 2:

- [ ] Multiple configuration sources are combined
- [ ] Precedence/order is documented
- [ ] Application reads from `IConfiguration`

---

#### THEORY 3: Explain environment-specific configuration and overrides.

#### PRACTICE 3: Use ASP.NET Core environment variables and `appsettings.{Environment}.json`.

#### CHECKLIST 3:

- [ ] Environment variable `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is set
- [ ] Environment-specific files override defaults
- [ ] No sensitive data in non-secure files

---

#### THEORY 4: Describe secure secrets management and its risks.

#### PRACTICE 4: Identify secrets (API keys, DB passwords) and remove them from source control.

#### CHECKLIST 4:

- [ ] No secrets in code or config files
- [ ] Secrets are retrieved at runtime
- [ ] Secret rotation is possible

---

#### THEORY 5: Explain the use of Azure Key Vault (or AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) in .NET.

#### PRACTICE 5: Integrate Azure Key Vault with ASP.NET Core configuration.

#### CHECKLIST 5:

- [ ] Key Vault is provisioned and access policies set
- [ ] Application retrieves secrets from Key Vault
- [ ] Local development uses secure alternatives

---

#### THEORY 6: Describe managed identities and secret access in the cloud.

#### PRACTICE 6: Use Azure Managed Identity to access Key Vault without credentials.

#### CHECKLIST 6:

- [ ] Managed Identity is enabled for app
- [ ] Key Vault access policy grants correct permissions
- [ ] No credentials are stored in app config

---

#### THEORY 7: Explain dynamic configuration reloading.

#### PRACTICE 7: Enable reloadOnChange for config files and test live reload.

#### CHECKLIST 7:

- [ ] `reloadOnChange: true` is set for config providers
- [ ] Application updates config without restart
- [ ] Reload failures are logged and handled

---

#### THEORY 8: Describe configuration validation on startup.

#### PRACTICE 8: Use `IValidateOptions<T>` to validate config sections.

#### CHECKLIST 8:

- [ ] Validation logic is implemented for config models
- [ ] App fails fast on invalid config
- [ ] Validation errors are clear

---

#### THEORY 9: Explain secret versioning and rotation.

#### PRACTICE 9: Rotate a secret in Key Vault and update application.

#### CHECKLIST 9:

- [ ] Old secret is replaced without downtime
- [ ] Application reloads new secret
- [ ] Rotation process is documented

---

#### THEORY 10: Describe feature flags and their role in modern DevOps.

#### PRACTICE 10: Integrate a feature flag system (e.g., Azure App Configuration, LaunchDarkly).

#### CHECKLIST 10:

- [ ] Feature flags are defined and toggled at runtime
- [ ] Feature rollout is safe and reversible
- [ ] Flags can be targeted by user/segment/environment

---

#### THEORY 11: Explain the difference between static and dynamic configuration.

#### PRACTICE 11: Implement both static (file-based) and dynamic (remote) config sources.

#### CHECKLIST 11:

- [ ] Static config is loaded at startup
- [ ] Dynamic config can be updated at runtime
- [ ] Failover to static config is possible

---

#### THEORY 12: Describe configuration encryption at rest and in transit.

#### PRACTICE 12: Ensure all config and secrets are encrypted.

#### CHECKLIST 12:

- [ ] Config files are encrypted on disk (if required)
- [ ] Secrets transit over TLS/HTTPS
- [ ] Encryption keys are managed securely

---

#### THEORY 13: Explain the use of user secrets for local development.

#### PRACTICE 13: Use `dotnet user-secrets` for local secret storage.

#### CHECKLIST 13:

- [ ] `UserSecretsId` is set in project file
- [ ] No secrets in local config files
- [ ] Local secrets never committed to source control

---

#### THEORY 14: Describe configuration for multi-tenant SaaS applications.

#### PRACTICE 14: Implement tenant-specific config loading and isolation.

#### CHECKLIST 14:

- [ ] Tenant config is loaded dynamically
- [ ] Tenant secrets are isolated
- [ ] Tenant config changes do not affect others

---

#### THEORY 15: Explain the role of configuration in blue/green and canary deployments.

#### PRACTICE 15: Use config/feature flags to control traffic and features per deployment slot.

#### CHECKLIST 15:

- [ ] Config can be changed per slot/environment
- [ ] Feature rollout is controlled by flags
- [ ] Rollback is quick via config/flag change

---

#### THEORY 16: Describe audit logging for configuration and secret changes.

#### PRACTICE 16: Enable and review audit logs for config/secret access and changes.

#### CHECKLIST 16:

- [ ] All config/secret changes are logged
- [ ] Access to secrets is auditable
- [ ] Alerts are set for suspicious changes

---

#### THEORY 17: Explain configuration drift and detection.

#### PRACTICE 17: Use tools to detect and alert on config drift (e.g., Azure Policy, AWS Config).

#### CHECKLIST 17:

- [ ] Baseline config is defined
- [ ] Drift from baseline is detected and alerted
- [ ] Remediation steps are documented

---

#### THEORY 18: Describe best practices for configuration in containers and serverless.

#### PRACTICE 18: Use environment variables and secret stores in Docker/Kubernetes/Azure Functions.

#### CHECKLIST 18:

- [ ] No secrets in container images
- [ ] Config is injected at runtime
- [ ] Container/serverless config is versioned

---

#### THEORY 19: Explain configuration as code and version control.

#### PRACTICE 19: Store non-secret config in source control, secrets in secure stores.

#### CHECKLIST 19:

- [ ] Config files are versioned and reviewed
- [ ] Secrets are never in source control
- [ ] Config changes are part of CI/CD
