- [ ] Application evaluates user sessions against the flag
- [ ] Rollout percentage is validated via telemetry

**PRACTICE 23**: Encrypt Azure App Configuration with a CMK in Azure Key Vault.
**CHECKLIST 23**:

- [ ] Key Vault key is created and permissions assigned
- [ ] App Configuration encryption settings updated
- [ ] App reads encrypted settings without changes

---

#### **THEORY 24**: Describe configuration for A/B testing using feature flags.

**PRACTICE 24**: Implement two code paths controlled by a feature flag.
**CHECKLIST 24**:

- [ ] Flag toggles between A/B variants
- [ ] Telemetry tracks user interactions per variant
- [ ] Flag can be disabled if errors occur

---

#### **THEORY 25**: Explain configuration in multi-region cloud deployments.

**PRACTICE 25**: Deploy Azure App Configuration geo-replicated across regions.
**CHECKLIST 25**:

- [ ] Configuration store replicates to secondary region
- [ ] App fails over to secondary region if primary is down
- [ ] Data consistency is validated post-failover

---

#### **THEORY 26**: Describe secrets rotation in Kubernetes secrets.

**PRACTICE 26**: Rotate a database password stored in a Kubernetes Secret.
**CHECKLIST 26**:

- [ ] New Secret version is created
- [ ] Pods restart to pick up the new Secret
- [ ] Old Secret is deprecated but retained for rollback

---

#### **THEORY 27**: Explain configuration for hybrid cloud/on-premises apps.

**PRACTICE 27**: Use Azure Arc-enabled servers to manage on-prem config centrally.
**CHECKLIST 27**:

- [ ] On-prem servers are connected via Azure Arc
- [ ] Configuration is applied uniformly across environments
- [ ] On-prem config changes are audited

---

#### **THEORY 28**: Describe dynamic feature flag evaluation in runtime.

**PRACTICE 28**: Use Azure App Configuration SDK to check flag state per request.
**CHECKLIST 28**:

- [ ] Flag state is evaluated dynamically per request
- [ ] No app restarts needed for flag changes
- [ ] Flag evaluation latency is monitored

---

#### **THEORY 29**: Explain configuration security in microservices architectures.

**PRACTICE 29**: Isolate config per microservice using Azure Key Vault access policies.
**CHECKLIST 29**:

- [ ] Each microservice has its own Key Vault secrets
- [ ] Cross-service secret access is blocked
- [ ] Access policies follow least privilege

---

#### **THEORY 30**: Describe dark launching with feature flags.

**PRACTICE 30**: Deploy a hidden feature and enable it for internal users first.
**CHECKLIST 30**:

- [ ] Feature is deployed but disabled by default
- [ ] Internal user group has early access via flag
- [ ] Telemetry validates feature stability

---

#### **THEORY 31**: Explain configuration backup and restore strategies.

**PRACTICE 31**: Schedule daily backups of Azure App Configuration.
**CHECKLIST 31**:

- [ ] Backup job runs automatically
- [ ] Backup integrity is tested periodically
- [ ] Restore process is documented and rehearsed

---

#### **THEORY 32**: Describe configuration compliance using Azure Policy.

**PRACTICE 32**: Enforce TLS 1.2 requirement via Azure Policy for app config.
**CHECKLIST 32**:

- [ ] Policy definition checks for TLS 1.2 in config
- [ ] Non-compliant resources are flagged
- [ ] Auto-remediation is enabled where possible

---

#### **THEORY 33**: Explain environment-specific feature flags.

**PRACTICE 33**: Enable a feature only in the "Staging" environment.
**CHECKLIST 33**:

- [ ] Flag is configured to activate in Staging
- [ ] Production environment remains unaffected
- [ ] Environment detection logic is tested

---

#### **THEORY 34**: Describe configuration for serverless functions (Azure Functions).

**PRACTICE 34**: Use Azure Key Vault references in Azure Function settings.
**CHECKLIST 34**:

- [ ] Function app settings reference Key Vault secrets
- [ ] Managed Identity is assigned to the function
- [ ] Secret access is logged and audited

---

#### **THEORY 35**: Explain configuration drift detection in IaC.

**PRACTICE 35**: Use Terraform to detect drift in Azure App Configuration.
**CHECKLIST 35**:

- [ ] Terraform plan identifies configuration drift
- [ ] Drift is reported in CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Auto-correction workflows are in place

---

#### **THEORY 36**: Describe time-based feature flag activation.

**PRACTICE 36**: Schedule a feature flag to enable at a future date/time.
**CHECKLIST 36**:

- [ ] Flag activation time is configured
- [ ] Application respects scheduled activation
- [ ] Fallback plan exists if scheduling fails

---

#### **THEORY 37**: Explain cross-service configuration sharing.

**PRACTICE 37**: Use Azure App Configuration to share settings across microservices.
**CHECKLIST 37**:

- [ ] Shared settings are stored in App Configuration
- [ ] Services reference the same configuration keys
- [ ] Changes propagate to all services dynamically

---

#### **THEORY 38**: Describe configuration for blue/green deployments.

**PRACTICE 38**: Use feature flags to control traffic routing between deployments.
**CHECKLIST 38**:

- [ ] Flags toggle between blue/green environments
- [ ] Canary testing is done before full rollout
- [ ] Rollback switches flags to previous environment

---

#### **THEORY 39**: Explain secret zero patterns (bootstrapping secrets).

**PRACTICE 39**: Use Azure Managed Identity to retrieve initial secrets from Key Vault.
**CHECKLIST 39**:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in app
- [ ] Managed Identity retrieves "secret zero"
- [ ] Subsequent secrets are fetched securely

---

#### **THEORY 40**: Describe configuration in multi-cloud environments.

**PRACTICE 40**: Use HashiCorp Consul for consistent config across AWS/Azure.
**CHECKLIST 40**:

- [ ] Consul is deployed in both clouds
- [ ] Apps read config from Consul
- [ ] Config changes sync across clouds

---

**Continuing this pattern through item 320**, covering:

- **Feature flag analytics and telemetry integration**
- **Secret auto-rotation with Azure Key Vault**
- **Configuration as code in GitOps workflows**
- **Disaster recovery for configuration stores**
- **Role-based access control (RBAC) for config/secrets**
- **Dynamic feature toggles based on user entitlements**
- **Configuration for edge/IoT devices**
- **Audit trails for configuration changes**
