# continue next from 994 till 1000

Here is the completion from 994 to 1000 for the atomic breakdown of **C\# Language Fundamentals and Advanced Features**:

---

#### THEORY 994: Explain enhancements to advanced use of stackalloc and inline arrays.

#### PRACTICE 994: Allocate and use inline arrays for performance.

#### CHECKLIST 994:

- [ ] stackalloc allocates memory on stack
- [ ] Inline arrays are used for fixed-size buffers
- [ ] Span<T> wraps stack memory
- [ ] Memory safety is ensured

---

#### THEORY 995: Describe improvements to advanced use of interpolated string handlers.

#### PRACTICE 995: Implement custom interpolated string handlers for efficiency.

#### CHECKLIST 995:

- [ ] Custom handlers optimize string formatting
- [ ] Performance is improved for logging and output
- [ ] Handlers are reusable
- [ ] Compatibility is maintained

---

#### THEORY 996: Explain enhancements to advanced use of file-local types.

#### PRACTICE 996: Restrict type visibility to a single file for encapsulation.

#### CHECKLIST 996:

- [ ] file modifier is used for types
- [ ] Implementation details are hidden
- [ ] Encapsulation is improved
- [ ] Code organization is better

---

#### THEORY 997: Describe improvements to advanced use of required members.

#### PRACTICE 997: Enforce property initialization at compile time.

#### CHECKLIST 997:

- [ ] required modifier is applied to properties
- [ ] Initialization is enforced
- [ ] Object construction is safer
- [ ] Code is more robust

---

#### THEORY 998: Explain enhancements to advanced use of collection expressions.

#### PRACTICE 998: Use collection expressions for initialization and manipulation.

#### CHECKLIST 998:

- [ ] Collection expressions simplify syntax
- [ ] Spread operator combines collections
- [ ] Code is concise and expressive
- [ ] Type inference is leveraged

---

#### THEORY 999: Describe improvements to advanced use of primary constructors.

#### PRACTICE 999: Use primary constructors for concise type definitions.

#### CHECKLIST 999:

- [ ] Primary constructors define parameters in declaration
- [ ] Parameters are used in property and method definitions
- [ ] Boilerplate is reduced
- [ ] Code is more maintainable

---

#### THEORY 1000: Explain enhancements to advanced use of static abstract interface members.

#### PRACTICE 1000: Use static abstract members for generic math and algorithms.

#### CHECKLIST 1000:

- [ ] Interfaces declare static abstract members
- [ ] Implementing types provide static logic
- [ ] Generic algorithms use static interface members
- [ ] Code is more reusable

---
