# breakdown next story from 0 to 250 which wasn't discovered yet in this chat according to skill matrix and my net roadmap

except cloud-native scope

Based on the .NET skill matrix and roadmap for 2025, and **excluding cloud-native topics**, the next major story that hasn't yet been broken down in this chat is **"C\# Language Fundamentals and Advanced Features"**.
