Here is the **start of the atomic breakdown for the next story: "Relational Databases"**
(batch size: maximum, non-repetitive, ready for Jira/PKM import, mapped to your skills matrix).

---

#### THEORY 1: Explain the purpose and structure of a relational database.

#### PRACTICE 1: Identify tables, columns, rows, and relationships in a sample schema.

#### CHECKLIST 1:

- [ ] Tables are defined with primary keys
- [ ] Columns have appropriate datatypes
- [ ] Relationships (foreign keys) are documented


#### THEORY 2: Describe the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.

#### PRACTICE 2: List use cases for relational vs. non-relational storage.

#### CHECKLIST 2:

- [ ] Use cases are categorized
- [ ] Pros and cons are documented
- [ ] Real-world examples are provided


#### THEORY 3: Explain the basic SQL commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

#### PRACTICE 3: Execute each command on a sample table.

#### CHECKLIST 3:

- [ ] SELECT retrieves expected data
- [ ] INSERT adds a new row
- [ ] UPDATE modifies an existing row
- [ ] DELETE removes a row


#### THEORY 4: Describe the use of the WHERE clause for filtering results.

#### PRACTICE 4: Write queries using WHERE with different operators.

#### CHECKLIST 4:

- [ ] Filtering by equality and range is tested
- [ ] Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) are used
- [ ] Results match expectations


#### THEORY 5: Explain the concept of primary keys and uniqueness.

#### PRACTICE 5: Define a primary key on a table and attempt to insert duplicate values.

#### CHECKLIST 5:

- [ ] Primary key constraint is enforced
- [ ] Duplicate insert fails
- [ ] Error is handled gracefully


#### THEORY 6: Describe the use of foreign keys and referential integrity.

#### PRACTICE 6: Create two related tables with a foreign key constraint.

#### CHECKLIST 6:

- [ ] Foreign key is defined
- [ ] Orphaned records are prevented
- [ ] Cascading deletes/updates are tested


#### THEORY 7: Explain the purpose and benefits of normalization.

#### PRACTICE 7: Normalize a denormalized table to 3NF.

#### CHECKLIST 7:

- [ ] Redundant data is eliminated
- [ ] Tables are split appropriately
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained


#### THEORY 8: Describe common datatypes used in relational databases.

#### PRACTICE 8: Create a table using int, varchar, datetime, decimal, and boolean columns.

#### CHECKLIST 8:

- [ ] Each datatype is used correctly
- [ ] Data is inserted and queried
- [ ] Type mismatches are handled


#### THEORY 9: Explain the use of JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).

#### PRACTICE 9: Write queries using each type of JOIN on sample tables.

#### CHECKLIST 9:

- [ ] All JOIN types return correct results
- [ ] NULL handling is understood
- [ ] Performance is compared


#### THEORY 10: Describe aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).

#### PRACTICE 10: Write queries using aggregation functions and GROUP BY.

#### CHECKLIST 10:

- [ ] Aggregates return expected results
- [ ] GROUP BY is used for summarization
- [ ] HAVING filters aggregate results

---

#### THEORY 11: Explain the use of indexes for query performance.

#### PRACTICE 11: Create indexes and compare query execution times.

#### CHECKLIST 11:

- [ ] Index is created and used by the query
- [ ] Query performance is measured
- [ ] Index maintenance is documented


#### THEORY 12: Describe the concept of unique and composite keys.

#### PRACTICE 12: Define unique and composite keys on tables.

#### CHECKLIST 12:

- [ ] Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- [ ] Composite key enforces multi-column uniqueness
- [ ] Violations are handled


#### THEORY 13: Explain the use of constraints (NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT).

#### PRACTICE 13: Add constraints to a table and test data entry.

#### CHECKLIST 13:

- [ ] NOT NULL prevents nulls
- [ ] CHECK enforces valid values
- [ ] DEFAULT assigns values automatically


#### THEORY 14: Describe the use of views for abstraction and security.

#### PRACTICE 14: Create a view to expose a subset of table columns.

#### CHECKLIST 14:

- [ ] View returns expected data
- [ ] Underlying table structure is hidden
- [ ] Permissions are set on the view


#### THEORY 15: Explain stored procedures and their benefits.

#### PRACTICE 15: Write a stored procedure for a common business operation.

#### CHECKLIST 15:

- [ ] Procedure accepts parameters
- [ ] Logic is encapsulated in the procedure
- [ ] Procedure is called from application code


#### THEORY 16: Describe user-defined functions (UDFs) and their use cases.

#### PRACTICE 16: Create a scalar and a table-valued function.

#### CHECKLIST 16:

- [ ] UDF returns correct results
- [ ] UDF is used in queries
- [ ] Performance is measured


#### THEORY 17: Explain the use of subqueries and nested SELECTs.

#### PRACTICE 17: Write queries with subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.

#### CHECKLIST 17:

- [ ] Subqueries return correct data
- [ ] Correlated subqueries are tested
- [ ] Alternatives are considered


#### THEORY 18: Describe common table expressions (CTEs) and recursive queries.

#### PRACTICE 18: Use a CTE to simplify a complex query and implement recursion.

#### CHECKLIST 18:

- [ ] CTE improves query readability
- [ ] Recursive CTE returns hierarchical data
- [ ] Performance is compared to subqueries


#### THEORY 19: Explain the use of transactions and ACID properties.

#### PRACTICE 19: Execute multiple operations in a transaction and handle rollback.

#### CHECKLIST 19:

- [ ] Transaction is committed/rolled back as needed
- [ ] Data integrity is preserved
- [ ] Error handling is robust


#### THEORY 20: Describe transaction isolation levels and concurrency control.

#### PRACTICE 20: Demonstrate effects of different isolation levels on concurrent transactions.

#### CHECKLIST 20:

- [ ] Dirty, non-repeatable, and phantom reads are tested
- [ ] Isolation level is set and documented
- [ ] Concurrency issues are handled
