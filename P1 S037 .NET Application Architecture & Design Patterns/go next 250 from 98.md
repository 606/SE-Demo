#### CHECKLIST 178:

- [ ] Event mesh connects services via events
- [ ] Choreography avoids central orchestrators
- [ ] Events are versioned and documented
- [ ] Eventual consistency is managed

---

#### THEORY 179: Explain the use of advanced rollback and recovery patterns.

#### PRACTICE 179: Implement rollback and compensation for distributed failures.

#### CHECKLIST 179:

- [ ] Rollback strategies are defined for all workflows
- [ ] Compensating transactions are implemented
- [ ] Recovery is automated where possible
- [ ] Testing covers failure and recovery paths

---

#### THEORY 180: Describe the use of advanced API governance (standards, linting, lifecycle).

#### PRACTICE 180: Enforce API standards and lifecycle management.

#### CHECKLIST 180:

- [ ] API standards are documented and enforced
- [ ] Linting tools check API conformance
- [ ] API lifecycle (versioning, deprecation) is managed
- [ ] Governance is reviewed regularly

---

#### THEORY 181: Explain the use of advanced architectural patterns for real-time systems.

#### PRACTICE 181: Architect for low-latency and real-time requirements.

#### CHECKLIST 181:

#### PRACTICE 182: Support offline usage and data synchronization.

#### CHECKLIST 182:

- [ ] Local caches store data offline
- [ ] Sync logic resolves conflicts
- [ ] User experience is seamless offline/online
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained

---

#### THEORY 183: Explain the use of advanced architectural patterns for multi-region and geo-distributed systems.

#### PRACTICE 183: Architect for multi-region deployment and failover.

#### CHECKLIST 183:

- [ ] Data is replicated across regions
- [ ] Failover is automatic and tested
- [ ] Latency is optimized for users
- [ ] Compliance and sovereignty are managed

---

#### THEORY 184: Describe the use of advanced API mesh and service mesh patterns.

#### PRACTICE 184: Integrate API mesh/service mesh for complex microservice topologies.
