# go next 800 after 330

Generating **800 atomic items** (theory, practice, checklist) in a single message is not possible due to platform constraints.
Here’s how I will proceed to ensure you get the full, continuous breakdown:

- I will generate the next **batch of 250 items** (from 331 to 580), then immediately continue with the next 250 (581–830), and then the final 220 (831–1050) in subsequent messages.
- This ensures you get a continuous, non-repetitive, high-quality sequence, as requested.
