Here’s the next batch of atomic items (theory, practice, checklist) for **"ASP.NET Core Key Features"**-continuing from item 71, and designed to cover advanced, cloud-native, and production-grade features, as required by your skills matrix and best practices.

---

#### THEORY 71: Explain the use of custom middleware for cross-cutting concerns.

#### CHECKLIST 72:

- [ ] Filters validate input before endpoint execution
- [ ] Logging is consistent across endpoints
- [ ] Filters can be reused


#### THEORY 73: Explain the use of global exception handling with UseExceptionHandler.

#### CHECKLIST 73:

- [ ] All exceptions are caught and logged
- [ ] User-friendly error responses are returned
- [ ] Error contracts are standardized


#### THEORY 74: Describe the use of the ProblemDetails standard for error responses.

#### PRACTICE 74: Return RFC 7807 ProblemDetails objects for API errors.

#### CHECKLIST 74:

- [ ] ProblemDetails includes status, title, detail, and traceId
- [ ] Error responses are consistent
- [ ] Documentation covers error format


#### THEORY 75: Explain how to use endpoint metadata and custom attributes.

#### PRACTICE 75: Create custom attributes for endpoints (e.g., [Audit], [FeatureFlag]).

#### CHECKLIST 75:

- [ ] Attributes are recognized by middleware or filters
- [ ] Behavior changes based on attributes
- [ ] Attribute usage is documented


#### THEORY 76: Describe the use of IApplicationBuilder for pipeline composition.

#### PRACTICE 76: Compose the middleware pipeline using IApplicationBuilder extensions.

#### CHECKLIST 76:

- [ ] Middleware is registered in correct order
- [ ] Pipeline is modular and maintainable
- [ ] Documentation covers extension methods


#### THEORY 77: Explain the use of endpoint grouping for modular APIs.

#### PRACTICE 77: Group related endpoints using MapGroup or area routing.

#### CHECKLIST 77:

- [ ] Endpoints are logically grouped
- [ ] Shared configuration is applied to groups
- [ ] Routing remains clear


#### THEORY 78: Describe the use of API conventions and custom conventions.

#### PRACTICE 78: Apply and document API conventions for consistent responses.

#### CHECKLIST 78:

- [ ] Conventions are enforced across controllers
- [ ] Custom conventions are documented
- [ ] Consistency is validated


#### THEORY 79: Explain the use of OpenAPI/Swagger customization.

#### PRACTICE 79: Customize Swagger docs with XML comments, examples, and authentication.

#### CHECKLIST 79:

- [ ] XML comments are included in Swagger
- [ ] Auth flows are documented in UI
- [ ] Examples and descriptions are thorough


#### THEORY 80: Describe the use of API explorer and endpoint discovery.

#### PRACTICE 80: Use IApiDescriptionProvider to inspect and document endpoints.

#### CHECKLIST 80:

- [ ] All endpoints are discoverable via API explorer
- [ ] Documentation is auto-generated
- [ ] Changes in endpoints update docs

---

#### THEORY 81: Explain the use of custom model binders for advanced scenarios.

#### PRACTICE 81: Bind complex request data using a custom model binder.

#### CHECKLIST 81:

- [ ] Binder handles edge cases (e.g., multi-part, custom formats)
- [ ] Validation is integrated
- [ ] Binder is unit tested


#### THEORY 82: Describe the use of input/output formatters for custom media types.

#### PRACTICE 82: Implement a custom input/output formatter (e.g., YAML, CSV).

#### CHECKLIST 82:

- [ ] Formatter is selected based on Accept/Content-Type
- [ ] Serialization/deserialization is robust
- [ ] Error handling is clear


#### THEORY 83: Explain the use of file providers for static content and embedded resources.

#### PRACTICE 83: Serve static files from embedded resources using IFileProvider.

#### CHECKLIST 83:

- [ ] Embedded files are accessible via endpoints
- [ ] Security is validated
- [ ] Performance is measured


#### THEORY 84: Describe the use of response buffering and streaming.

#### PRACTICE 84: Stream large files or data from an API endpoint.

#### CHECKLIST 84:

- [ ] Streaming is efficient and non-blocking
- [ ] Buffering is controlled
- [ ] Resource usage is monitored


#### THEORY 85: Explain the use of custom authorization policies and handlers.

#### PRACTICE 85: Create and apply a custom authorization requirement.

#### CHECKLIST 85:

- [ ] Requirement enforces business logic
- [ ] Policy is applied to endpoints
- [ ] Tests validate authorization


#### THEORY 86: Describe the use of claims transformation and enrichment.

#### PRACTICE 86: Enrich user claims after authentication using IClaimsTransformation.

#### CHECKLIST 86:

- [ ] Claims are enriched before controller access
- [ ] Security is validated
- [ ] Documentation covers scenarios


#### THEORY 87: Explain the use of distributed tracing and correlation.

#### PRACTICE 87: Integrate OpenTelemetry or Application Insights for distributed tracing.

#### CHECKLIST 87:

- [ ] Traces are collected across services
- [ ] Correlation IDs are propagated
- [ ] Tracing is visualized in dashboards


#### THEORY 88: Describe the use of custom health checks for external dependencies.

#### PRACTICE 88: Add health checks for database, cache, and external APIs.

#### CHECKLIST 88:

- [ ] Health status reflects real dependency state
- [ ] Health endpoints are secured
- [ ] Alerts are configured for failures
