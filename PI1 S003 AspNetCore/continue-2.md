Here’s the next batch of atomic items (theory, practice, checklist) for **"ASP.NET Core Key Features"**-continuing from the previous set and following your skills matrix[^1]. This batch is designed to cover more advanced, cloud-native, and production-grade ASP.NET Core features, as required for a .NET AWS Cloud Native Software Engineer.

---

#### THEORY 51: Explain the use of dependency injection scopes in ASP.NET Core.

#### PRACTICE 51: Register and resolve services with different lifetimes in a web request.

#### CHECKLIST 51:

- [ ] Transient, Scoped, and Singleton services behave as expected
- [ ] Object lifetimes are documented
- [ ] Memory leaks are checked


#### THEORY 52: Describe the use of strongly typed options and configuration validation.

#### PRACTICE 52: Bind appsettings.json to a POCO with IOptions and validate at startup.

#### CHECKLIST 52:

- [ ] Configuration binds to POCO
- [ ] Validation errors are caught at startup
- [ ] Documentation covers best practices


#### THEORY 53: Explain the concept of middleware short-circuiting.

#### PRACTICE 53: Implement middleware that terminates the pipeline early.

#### CHECKLIST 53:

- [ ] Middleware can return a response directly
- [ ] Downstream middleware is not executed
- [ ] Logging confirms pipeline behavior


#### THEORY 54: Describe endpoint filters and their use cases.

#### PRACTICE 54: Add an endpoint filter to modify requests or responses.

#### CHECKLIST 54:

- [ ] Filter logic executes before/after endpoint
- [ ] Filter modifies request/response as intended
- [ ] Use cases are documented


#### THEORY 55: Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous middleware.

#### PRACTICE 55: Implement both sync and async middleware in a sample app.

#### CHECKLIST 55:

- [ ] Both middleware types work as expected
- [ ] Async middleware does not block threads
- [ ] Performance is measured


#### THEORY 56: Describe the use of endpoint metadata for documentation and policies.

#### PRACTICE 56: Add custom metadata to endpoints and consume it in middleware.

#### CHECKLIST 56:

- [ ] Metadata is attached to endpoints
- [ ] Middleware reads and reacts to metadata
- [ ] Documentation covers scenarios


#### THEORY 57: Explain the use of endpoint grouping and route pattern matching.

#### PRACTICE 57: Group endpoints and use advanced route patterns.

#### CHECKLIST 57:

- [ ] Grouped endpoints share configuration
- [ ] Route patterns match as expected
- [ ] Documentation includes examples


#### THEORY 58: Describe the use of custom model binders.

#### PRACTICE 58: Implement a custom model binder for a complex type.

#### CHECKLIST 58:

- [ ] Custom binder is invoked
- [ ] Model is bound correctly from request
- [ ] Edge cases are tested


#### THEORY 59: Explain the use of custom formatters for input/output.

#### PRACTICE 59: Add a custom output formatter (e.g., CSV) to an API.

#### CHECKLIST 59:

- [ ] API returns data in custom format
- [ ] Formatter is selected based on Accept header
- [ ] Error handling is implemented


#### THEORY 60: Describe the use of global error handling and ProblemDetails responses.

#### PRACTICE 60: Implement a global exception handler that returns RFC 7807 ProblemDetails.

#### CHECKLIST 60:

- [ ] All unhandled errors return ProblemDetails
- [ ] Error codes and messages are standardized
- [ ] Documentation covers error contracts

---

#### THEORY 61: Explain the use of data annotations and FluentValidation.

#### PRACTICE 61: Validate models using both data annotations and FluentValidation.

#### CHECKLIST 61:

- [ ] Validation errors are returned in API responses
- [ ] Custom validators are tested
- [ ] Validation logic is documented


#### THEORY 62: Describe the use of anti-forgery tokens in APIs and UI.

#### PRACTICE 62: Implement and validate anti-forgery tokens in forms and AJAX requests.

#### CHECKLIST 62:

- [ ] Tokens are required and validated
- [ ] CSRF is prevented in all endpoints
- [ ] Security is tested


#### THEORY 63: Explain the use of HTTP context and accessing request/response data.

#### PRACTICE 63: Read and modify headers, cookies, and request info in middleware.

#### CHECKLIST 63:

- [ ] Headers and cookies are read/written
- [ ] Request/response manipulation is logged
- [ ] Security implications are documented


#### THEORY 64: Describe the use of session state in ASP.NET Core.

#### PRACTICE 64: Store and retrieve session data in a web app.

#### CHECKLIST 64:

- [ ] Session is enabled and persists data
- [ ] Expiration and security are tested
- [ ] Documentation notes stateless vs. stateful


#### THEORY 65: Explain the use of distributed cache for session and data.

#### PRACTICE 65: Configure Redis or SQL Server distributed cache for session storage.

#### CHECKLIST 65:

- [ ] Cache is used for session persistence
- [ ] Failover and cache expiration are tested
- [ ] Performance is measured


#### THEORY 66: Describe the use of response caching and cache profiles.

#### PRACTICE 66: Add response caching middleware and set cache profiles on endpoints.

#### CHECKLIST 66:

- [ ] Cache headers are set and respected
- [ ] Cached responses are returned as expected
- [ ] Cache invalidation is tested


#### THEORY 67: Explain the use of output caching in ASP.NET Core 7+.

#### PRACTICE 67: Implement output caching for API endpoints.

#### CHECKLIST 67:

- [ ] Output cache is configured and effective
- [ ] Cache key variation is tested
- [ ] Documentation covers scenarios


#### THEORY 68: Describe the use of custom authorization handlers and requirements.

#### PRACTICE 68: Create a custom authorization handler for a business rule.

#### CHECKLIST 68:

- [ ] Handler enforces custom rule
- [ ] Policy is applied to endpoints
- [ ] Unit tests validate handler logic


#### THEORY 69: Explain the use of claims transformation.

#### PRACTICE 69: Implement a claims transformation service to enrich user claims.

#### CHECKLIST 69:

- [ ] Claims are modified after authentication
- [ ] Claims are available in controllers
- [ ] Security is validated


#### THEORY 70: Describe the use of policy-based CORS configuration.
