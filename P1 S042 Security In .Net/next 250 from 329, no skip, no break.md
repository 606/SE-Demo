- [ ] Refactor code to use modern .NET equivalents where possible.
- [ ] Apply compensating controls if refactoring is not feasible.
- [ ] Prioritize migration away from unsupported framework versions.

THEORY 406: Explain security implications of COM components.
PRACTICE 406: Securely interact with COM objects from .NET.

PRACTICE 407: Write secure P/Invoke calls.
CHECKLIST 407:

- [ ] Validate all parameters passed to native functions (especially sizes, pointers).
- [ ] Check return values and error codes from native functions.
- [ ] Use correct marshalling attributes (`MarshalAs`).
- [ ] Prevent buffer overflows when passing string or array data.
- [ ] Ensure native library itself is secure and trusted.

THEORY 408: Explain security implications of C++/CLI usage.
PRACTICE 408: Write secure C++/CLI code bridging managed and native.
CHECKLIST 408:

- [ ] Combines .NET and native C++ risks.
- [ ] Manage memory carefully (managed heap vs. native heap).
- [ ] Validate data passed between managed and native code.
- [ ] Apply secure coding practices for both C\#/.NET and C++.

THEORY 409: Describe security implications of Blazor JavaScript Interop.
PRACTICE 409: Securely call JavaScript from Blazor and vice-versa.
CHECKLIST 409:

- [ ] Validate data passed between .NET and JavaScript.
- [ ] Avoid executing untrusted JavaScript code.
- [ ] Sanitize data returned from JavaScript calls before using in .NET.
- [ ] Limit scope of exposed .NET methods (`[JSInvokable]`).
- [ ] Use JS isolation for component-specific interop.

THEORY 410: Explain security implications of .NET MAUI native embedding.
PRACTICE 410: Securely host MAUI content within native applications.
CHECKLIST 410:

- [ ] Secure the communication bridge between native and MAUI code.
- [ ] Validate data passed across the boundary.
- [ ] Ensure consistent security context (authentication, authorization).
- [ ] Apply security hardening to both native host and embedded MAUI content.

THEORY 411: Describe security implications of serverless cold starts.
PRACTICE 411: Consider cold start impact on security operations.
CHECKLIST 411:

- [ ] Ensure security initialization (e.g., loading secrets, validating config) completes correctly during cold start.
- [ ] Monitor for increased latency in security checks during cold starts.
- [ ] Optimize function startup time to minimize cold start duration.
- [ ] Test security behavior during and after cold starts.

THEORY 412: Explain security implications of long-running serverless functions.
PRACTICE 412: Secure functions designed for longer execution times.
CHECKLIST 412:

- [ ] Ensure function timeout is appropriate but not excessive.
- [ ] Handle potential credential expiration during long runs.
- [ ] Implement checkpointing or state persistence for resilience.
- [ ] Monitor resource consumption over function lifetime.

THEORY 413: Describe security implications of serverless function triggers.
PRACTICE 413: Secure function triggers (HTTP, Queue, Event, etc.).
CHECKLIST 413:

- [ ] **HTTP:** Use function keys, API keys, or proper AuthN/AuthZ.
- [ ] **Queue/Event:** Secure access to the message source. Validate message content. Implement idempotency.
